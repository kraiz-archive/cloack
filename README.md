Cloack is a little experimental visualization of an analog clock drawn as circular arc.

Try it at http://kraiz.github.io/cloack .

Read it from the (clockwise) beginning of the black part (that's the minute arm of the clock)
to the end (the arm for hours).

There's also a debug mode which let the time run a bit faster :)
